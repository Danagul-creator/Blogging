        <h1>World's most recognizable landmarks</h1>
        <p class="description">From the boulevards of Paris to the fashionable seaside resorts of the Côte d'Azur, France offers some of the most beautiful scenery in the world. Fairy-tale castles, glorious cathedrals, and picture-perfect villages delight romantics. At the same time, the country's contemporary monuments and rapid train transit jolt visitors from the storybook surroundings into the ambience of the 21st century.</p>

        <h1>Delicate desserts</h1>
        <p class="description">We all have our favorite go-to desserts for dinner parties, casual guests, and cozy family dinners. From light fruit flavors to dense, dark chocolate, there's a delicious recipe for every palette and these authentic French desserts are no different. France is renowned for its wonderful desserts and pastries--in fact, we wouldn't have the word dessert if it weren't for the French word desservir, meaning to un-serve the main components of the meal.</p>
